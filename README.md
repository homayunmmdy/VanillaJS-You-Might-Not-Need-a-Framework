## **Course Notes**

This repository contains my personal notes and code examples from the Vanilla JavaScript: You Might Not Need a Framework course on Frontend Masters, taught by Maximiliano Firtman.

## ðŸŽ¯ About the Course

This course explores how to build fast, modern web applications using only core JavaScript without relying on frameworks like React, Next.js, or Vue. Taught by experienced developer and consultant Maximiliano Firtman, it covers topics such as:

- DOM API
- Querying and modifying DOM elements
- Event handling and delegation
- SPA routing using the History API
- Creating reusable Web Components with Shadow DOM
- Building custom templates
- Reactive programming with JavaScript Proxies


The course builds a full featured app called Coffee Masters using only vanilla JS demonstrating how capable and powerful plain JavaScript can be when architected properly.

## ðŸš€ Why This Matters

I took this course to expand my JavaScript toolkit and see whatâ€™s possible without any framework or library. It turns out we donâ€™t always need React, Next.js, or anything else. With just pure JavaScript, we can:

- Build SPAs
- Create reusable UI components
- Manage state reactively
- Bind forms and render dynamic views

Itâ€™s faster, cleaner, and gives you full control. Yes, itâ€™s easier to mess things up, but once mastered, Vanilla JS becomes a reliable tool for micro frontends, minimal apps, or even performance critical parts of bigger applications.

## ðŸ“¢ Note on Course Access

Due to international sanctions in Iran, I was unable to access the official Frontend Masters platform directly. I obtained the course through a third-party distributor and completed it in full. Although I donâ€™t hold an official certificate, I carefully followed the course and documented my learnings here.

For hands on sections, youâ€™ll find working code samples. For theory-heavy parts, Iâ€™ve included detailed summaries and examples that reflect my understanding of the material.
