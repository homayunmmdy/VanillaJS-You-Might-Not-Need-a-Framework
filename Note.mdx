## Vanilla JavaScript

The usage of the core language and browser APIs to
create web apps without any additional libraries or
frameworks added on top.

## Why do we need to care about VanillaJS ?

- add one more tool to your toolbox
- Understand what your library is doing
- Extend your library with plugins
- Be a better web developer
- To mix with libraries
- Frontendmasters.com is VanillaJS!
- To use it
  You can create simple and fast web apps with not CLI, no build process.

## Main Advantages of Vanilla JS

- Lightweight
- Control and Power
- Simplicity
- Flexibility
- Performance
- Compatibility
- No node-modules

## Main Fear of Vanilla JS

- Routing for Single Page Applications
- Too Verbose and Time Consuming
- State Management
- Templating
- Complexity
- Reusable Components
- Maintenance
- Learning Curve
- Browser Compatibility
- Reinventing the Wheel every Time
- Scalability

## DOM

The Document Object Model connects web pages to JavaScript by representing the
structure of a document in memory.

## DOM API

A browser API exposed to developer to manipulate the DOM from an scripting language.

### The DOM API is available on many objects

**window** global object
**document** object
One object per HTML element and other need in your document.

### TO work with DOM elements , we can...

- Pick them from the current DOM
- Create them , and then inject then into the DOM

### When we have a reference to an element we can

- Read its content
- Change its content
- Remove it
- Add new elements to it

## Select elements from the DOM

- By ID
- By Class Name
- By Name
- By css Selector
- Navigating DOM structure

### When selecting elements , some functions return...

- One HTML element (HTMLElement)
- A Live HTML element collection (HTMLCollection)
- Static element collection (NodeList)

### Function to get a reference to one DOM element

- getElementById
- querySelector

When you use a Function that returns one element, it can also return null if no
node was found.

### Function to get a reference to multiple DOM elements

- getELementByTagName
- getElementByClassName
- querySelectorAll()
- getElementByName

When you use a function that returns multiple elements, it ca also return
an empty collection if no element were found.

HTMLCollection (live) don't have all the modern Array interface, such as
filter, map , reduce or forEach.

You can add modern array functions to HTMLCollection by creating
a Array from it using Array.from(collection)

## With an HTML Element in JavaScript you can

- Read and change attributes value
- Read and change styles
- Hook event listeners
- Add,remove or move children elements
- Read and change it contents
- More APIs

## How to read or change attribute of DOM element

```javascript
element.hidden = false;
element.src = "logo.png";
element.className = "myClass";
```

## How to read or change styles of DOM element

```javascript
element.style.color = "blue";
element.style.fontSize = "1.2em";
element.style.borderRightColor = "#FCFCFC";
```

## How to listen to event of an HTML element

```javascript
element.addEventLister('event name', function)
```

or

```javascript
function eventHandler(event) {
  // do something
}
element.addEventLister("event name", eventHandler);
```

or this way too

```javascript
element.addEventLister("click", (event) => {
  // do something
});
```

### Accessing and Editing Contents of the Elements

- Accessing textContent
- Accessing innerHTML
- Using DOM APIs to create new nodes

#### Working with textContent

```javascript
const element = document.querySelector("#message");

// we read the current element's content as string
const content = element.textContent;

// We change the contents of the element with a new string
element.textContent = "The text has been changed";
```

#### Working with innerHTML

```javascript
const element = document.querySelector("#section-6 header");

// we read the current element's content as string
const content = element.textContent;

// We change the contents of the element with a new string
element.textContent = `
  <h1>My App</h1>
  <p>The best platform for learning frontend</p>
`;
```

#### Working with DOM API to create or edit content

```javascript
const element = document.querySelector("#section-6 header");

const h1 = document.createElement("h1");
h1.textContent = "My App";
element.appendChild(h1);

const p = document.createElement("p");
p.textContent = "The best platform for learning frontend";
element.appendChild(p);
```

## Scoping querySelector

querySelector always pick the first element if you want multiple you have to use querySelectorAll it's pick them inside array
if the thing you select is not exist the querySelector will show null but querySelectorAll show empty NodeList.

if we have nav and we want to get the span inside it we do this

```javascript
document.querySelector("span#badge");
```

now we add query for hole DOM we can narrow this like this

```javascript
const nav = document.querySelector("nav");
nav.querySelector("span#badge");
```

now we scope the DOM it's only search inside the nav which can improve the Performance

## DOMContentLoaded VS load

**load:** is waiting to everything in the page to be loaded styles , images , fonts when everything is ready.
**DOMContentLoaded:** it's mean to load as soon as possible this happened before rendering

## More on Event Binding

- Each DOM element has a list of possible events we can listen to.
- Basic: load , click , dblclick
- value change
- Keyboard Events keyup, keydown,keypress
- Mouse Event mouseover , mouseout , getElementByClassName
- Pointer and Touch Events
- Scroll, Focus more APIs
- Some specific objects have special events
- DOMContentLoaded, popstate in window

> The spec's naming pattern is to use lowercase with no word separator for event
> names. That's why we can end up with name like this
> **webkitcurrentplaybacktargetiswirelesschanged**

## Binding function to event in DOM objects

- onevent Properties (e.g., onclick, onload)

```javascript
function eventHandler(event) {
  // Handler logic
}

element.onclick = eventHandler;
element.onclick = (event) => {
  // This REPLACES the previous handler
};
```

### Why it gets replaced:

- Each **onevent** property can only hold one function reference
- Assigning a new handler overwrites the previous one
- Behaves like any other object property assignment

- addEventLister

```javascript
function eventHandler(event) {
  // Handler logic
}

element.addEventListener("click", eventHandler);
element.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  // This ADDS to existing handlers
});
```

### Why it doesn't replace:

- Maintains an internal list of handlers for each event type
- can register multiple handlers for the same event
- More flexible for complex Applications

### Advance Event Handler

```javascript
function eventHandler(event) {}

const options = {
  once: true, //by default is false
  passive: true,
};

element.addEventListener("load", eventHandler, options);
```

in the code example after once the event is removed.
**remove** in browser we don't do the clean up and when user leave the page
everything happened automatic and only this useful for Single page application.

```javascript
element.removeEventListener("load", eventHandler);
```

### Dispatching Custom Event

```javascript
const event = new Event("mycustomname");
element.dispatchEvent(event);
```

### helpful shorthand methods

here is an example that you can change your repetitive task.

```javascript
const $ = () => document.querySelector.call(this, arguments);
const $$ = () => document.querySelectorAll.call(this, arguments);
HTMLElement.prototype.on = (a, b, c) => this.addEventListener(a, b, c);
HTMLElement.prototype.off = (a, b) => this.removeEventListener(a, b);
HTMLElement.prototype.$ = (s) => this.querySelector(s);
HTMLElement.prototype.$ = (s) => this.querySelectorAll(s);
```

## Single Page Applications : how to change content

- Remove Previous Page and Inject New Page into the DOM
- Hide Previous Page and Show Current Page

### History API

we can push new "fake" navigation URLs and listen for changes

```javascript
// pushing a new URL; the second argument is unused
history.pushSate(optional_state, null, "/new-url");

// to listen for changes in URL within the same page nvigation
window.addEventListener("popstate", (event) => {
  let url = location.href;
});
```

> popstate won't be fired if the user clicks on an external link or change the URL manually

> If you are creating a SPA, configure your server properly and check the URL when the whole page loads for first time.

## Children and ChildNode

childNodes returns child nodes (element nodes, text nodes, and comment nodes). children returns child elements (not text and comment nodes).

> Make the Router by receiving a collection of routes (paths as regex and Component to render)

## Web Component

A modular, reusable building block for web development that encapsulates a set of related
functionality and user interface elements.

> In short , your own custom HTML tag element.

- Compatible with every browser
- It's actually a set of standards:
- **Custom Elements**
- **HTML Templates**
- **Shadow DOM**
- Declarative Shadow DOM
- It's similar to the idea of Component on most of the libraries for javascript
- we have freedom of choice on how to define them and use them.

### Custom Element

A way to define new , reusable HTML elements with custom
behavior and functionality using JavaScript.

> The HTML tag we define must contain a hyphen (-) to assure future Compatibility

### Custom Element Lifecycle

we can override some methods of the super class

```javascript
class MyElement extends HTMLElement {

  constructor { // set up initial state , event listeners, etc.
    super()
  }
  connectedCallback()     // The element is added to the document
  disconnectCallback()    // The element is removed to the document
  adoptCallback()         // The element has been moved to a new document

  attributeChangedCallback(name , olValue,new Value()) {}
}

customElement.define('my-element', MyElement);
```

## Custom Element with Slots

The slot is the content that we can define the component's children with templates
we can have more than one slot.

```javascript
class MyElement extends HTMLElement {

  constructor {
    super()
  }
}

customElement.define('my-element', MyElement);
```

```html
<body>
  <my-element>
    <div>
      <h2>Slot of My Element</h2>
    </div>
  </my-element>
  <body></body>
</body>
```

## Custom Element with Customized Builtins

We can extend HTML elements with our won implementation

> Not available in Safari in 2023

```html
<div is="my-element"></div>
```

## Template Element

Fragments of markup that ca be cloned and inserted into document at runtime,
with reusable HTML content that ca be rendered an modified dynamically.

> It allow us to define HTML content that is not going to be parsed by the browser and it's going to be available fo usage only if we clone it.

```html
<template id="template1">
  <header>
    <h1>This is a template</h1>
    <p>This content is not render initially</p>
  </header>
</template>
```

### Template Element Cloning

We clone the template and we append it as a child; typically in **connectedCallback**
method of the Custom Element.

```javascript
connectedCallback() {
  const template = document.getElementById('template1');
  const content = template.content.cloneNode(true);
  this.appendChild(content);
}
```

> By default, the nodes of our custom element are part of the same page's
> DOM,so CSS style declaration applies to all document.

```html
<template id="template1">
  <style>
    /*this declaration als changes h1s outside of the custom element*/
    h1 {
      color: red;
    }
  </style>
  <header>
    <h1>This is a template</h1>
    <p>This content is not render initially</p>
  </header>
</template>
```

## Shadow DOM

A private, isolated DOM tree within a web component that is separate from the main document's DOM tree.

- Allows more control over styling and encapsulation of functionality of a Custom Element
- By default, Css declared in the main DOM won't be applied to the Shadow DOM.
- CSS declared in the Shadow DOM applies only on there.
- There are new pseudo-classes and pseudo-element to allow communication between DOMs in stylesheet.
- It can be opened or closed defining visibility from the outer DOM.

> We have to create a Shadow DOM manually in our Custom Element, typically in the constructor and we save it.

```javascript
class MyElement extend HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.root = this.attachShadow({mode: "open"})
  }

  connectedCallback() {
    this.root.appendChild(...)
  }
}
```

after this your style declaration ONLY changes h1s inside the custom elements

### Where to define HTML for a Custom Element

- There are several alternatives
  - Use DOM APIs
  - Use a <code>template</code> in the main HTML
  - Use an external HTML file loaded with fetch (it can be prefetched)
  - Using innerHTML
  - Using DOMParser
