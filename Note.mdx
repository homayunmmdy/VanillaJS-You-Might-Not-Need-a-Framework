## Vanilla JavaScript

The usage of the core language and browser APIs to
create web apps without any additional libraries or
frameworks added on top.

## Why do we need to care about VanillaJS ?

- add one more tool to your toolbox
- Understand what your library is doing
- Extend your library with plugins
- Be a better web developer
- To mix with libraries
- Frontendmasters.com is VanillaJS!
- To use it
  You can create simple and fast web apps with not CLI, no build process.

## Main Advantages of Vanilla JS

- Lightweight
- Control and Power
- Simplicity
- Flexibility
- Performance
- Compatibility
- No node-modules

## Main Fear of Vanilla JS

- Routing for Single Page Applications
- Too Verbose and Time Consuming
- State Management
- Templating
- Complexity
- Reusable Components
- Maintenance
- Learning Curve
- Browser Compatibility
- Reinventing the Wheel every Time
- Scalability

## DOM

The Document Object Model connects web pages to JavaScript by representing the
structure of a document in memory.

## DOM API

A browser API exposed to developer to manipulate the DOM from an scripting language.

### The DOM API is available on many objects

**window** global object
**document** object
One object per HTML element and other need in your document.

### TO work with DOM elements , we can...

- Pick them from the current DOM
- Create them , and then inject then into the DOM

### When we have a reference to an element we can

- Read its content
- Change its content
- Remove it
- Add new elements to it

## Select elements from the DOM

- By ID
- By Class Name
- By Name
- By css Selector
- Navigating DOM structure

### When selecting elements , some functions return...

- One HTML element (HTMLElement)
- A Live HTML element collection (HTMLCollection)
- Static element collection (NodeList)

### Function to get a reference to one DOM element

- getElementById
- querySelector

When you use a Function that returns one element, it can also return null if no
node was found.

### Function to get a reference to multiple DOM elements

- getELementByTagName
- getElementByClassName
- querySelectorAll()
- getElementByName

When you use a function that returns multiple elements, it ca also return
an empty collection if no element were found.

HTMLCollection (live) don't have all the modern Array interface, such as
filter, map , reduce or forEach.

You can add modern array functions to HTMLCollection by creating
a Array from it using Array.from(collection)

## With an HTML Element in JavaScript you can 
- Read and change attributes value
- Read and change styles 
- Hook event listeners
- Add,remove or move children elements 
- Read and change it contents
- More APIs
